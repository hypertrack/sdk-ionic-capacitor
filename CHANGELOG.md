## [Unreleased]

## [4.0.2] - 2025-03-04

### Changed

- Updated HyperTrack SDK iOS to [5.11.1](https://github.com/hypertrack/sdk-ios/releases/tag/5.11.1)
- Updated HyperTrack SDK Android to [7.11.2](https://github.com/hypertrack/sdk-android/releases/tag/7.11.2)

## [4.0.1] - 2025-02-05

### Fixed

- Error on `HyperTrack.getOrders()`/`HyperTrack.subscribeToOrders()` on Android when assigning multiple orders to the worker

## [4.0.0] - 2025-02-03

### Changed

- `Order.isInsideGeofence` is now an async fuction that returns the value at the moment when it called (instead of the constant value at the time of `getOrders` being called)
- Updated HyperTrack SDK iOS to [5.11.0](https://github.com/hypertrack/sdk-ios/releases/tag/5.11.0)
- Updated HyperTrack SDK Android to [7.11.0](https://github.com/hypertrack/sdk-android/releases/tag/7.11.0)

### Fixed

- Wrong order of Orders in `HyperTrack.getOrders()` on iOS

## [3.8.0] - 2025-01-17

### Added

- New `HyperTrack.getAllowMockLocation()` and `HyperTrack.setAllowMockLocation()` methods which can be used to allow mocking location data.
  - Check the [Test with mock locations](https://hypertrack.com/docs/mock-location) guide for more information.
  - Note: To avoid issues related to race conditions in your code use this API **only if** modifying the compiled `HyperTrackAllowMockLocation` AndroidManifest.xml/Info.plist value is insufficient for your needs.
    - Example: if for some reason you aren't able to recompile with `HyperTrackAllowMockLocation` set to `YES`/`true` for your prod app QA mock location tests and need to set up the value in runtime.

### Fixed

- Serialization bug for `Order.isInsideGeofence` success case on iOS

## [3.5.0] - 2024-08-22

### Added

- Support for on-device geofencing via new `HyperTrack.orders.get("my_order_handle").isInsideGeofence` property
  - To learn more about how to best use this new feature see our guide here: [Verify shift presence before starting work](https://developer.hypertrack.com/docs/clock-in-out-tagging#verify-shift-presence-before-starting-work)

Example use for worker clock in:

```typescript
// check worker presence synchronously
let activeOrders = await HyperTrack.getOrders()
let currentOrder = activeOrders.get("current_order")
if (currentOrder !== undefined) { handlePresence(currentOrder) }
else { console.log("'current_order' not found") }

// or subscribe to the changes in orders to get the status updates
HyperTrack.subscribeToOrders(orders => {
  let let currentOrder = activeOrders.get("current_order")
  if (currentOrder !== undefined) { handlePresence(currentOrder) }
  else { console.log("'current_order' not found") }
})

// handle worker presence inside the order destination geofence
function handlePresence(isInsideGeofence: Result<boolean, LocationError>) {
  switch (isInsideGeofence.type) {
    case 'success':
      if (isInsideGeofence.value) {
        // allow worker to clock in for the shift
      } else {
        // "to clock in you must be at order destination"
      }
      break;
    case 'failure':
      // resolve errors to check for presence
      break;
  }
}
```

### Changed

- Updated HyperTrack SDK Android to [7.7.0](https://github.com/hypertrack/sdk-android/releases/tag/7.7.0)

## [3.4.0] - 2024-06-13

### Added

- New `setWorkerHandle` and `getWorkerHandle` can be used to identify workers
  - We observed our customers identify worker devices via `HyperTrack.metadata`, so we decided to make it a first class citizen in our API.
  - If you previously used `metadata` to identify workers, we suggest using `workerHandle` for this purpose instead.
